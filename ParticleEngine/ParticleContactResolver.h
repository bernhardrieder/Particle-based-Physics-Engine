	* @param numIterations The number of iterations through the
	* resolution algorithm. This should be at least the number of
	* contacts (otherwise some constraints will not be resolved -
	* although sometimes this is not noticable). If the
	* iterations are not needed they will not be used, so adding
	* more iterations may not make any difference. But in some

	* number, sometimes the algorithm WILL use it, and you may
	* drop frames.
	*
	* @param duration The duration of the previous integration step.
	* This is used to compensate for forces applied.
